Automation and composer tool able to compose content from dynamic widgets, and perform operations on those (e.g. mail, blog post, send to API) based on triggers (finance quotes, API JSONPath transformed calls, recurring schedule). Similar to zapier with fewer applications but simpler interface and rich editors for widgets.

Initially with a mix of AWS serverless and Quarkus microservices on MySQL. Currently almost entirely on Spring.
